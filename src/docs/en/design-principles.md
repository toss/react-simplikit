# Design Principles

`react-simplikit` is designed to be lightweight, reliable, and easy to use. The following principles serve as the foundation for its design.

## Respect React's Lifecycle Without Interference

`react-simplikit` avoids interfering with React's lifecycle.  
For example, it does not provide hooks like `useMount` or `useLifecycles` that directly manipulate React's lifecycle. Instead, it respects React's default behaviors and encourages leveraging them effectively.

## Lightweight and Fast With Zero Dependencies

`react-simplikit` is entirely free of external dependencies.  
By not relying on additional libraries, it minimizes bundle size when integrated into a project and avoids any performance overhead caused by dependencies.

## Ensures Reliability With 100% Test Coverage

`react-simplikit` emphasizes reliability by thoroughly testing all functions and code paths.  
Each implementation is rigorously tested to prevent unexpected behaviors and ensure stability. If you're looking for a trustworthy library, `react-simplikit` is a great choice.

## Comprehensive Documentation for Ease of Use

`react-simplikit` provides detailed documentation to help users quickly understand and utilize its features. The documentation includes:

- **JSDoc Comments**: Detailed descriptions of each function, including their behavior, parameters, and return values.
- **Comprehensive Guides**: Clear and beginner-friendly instructions to help users get started immediately.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples that demonstrate how to use the library effectively in practical scenarios.

While the primary documentation is written in English, Korean translations are also available, making it accessible to Korean-speaking users.
